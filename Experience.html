		<center><p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size:120%">I started my internship at Politeknik Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah at the end of February.<br>As a Library Management student I chose to do my internship at their library according to the requirements of the internship.<br>The duration of my internship is only for 6 weeks but I learnt a lot of things from the librarian and people around me. Thus, I get to feel the real work environment and suit myself in that environment very well. At first, my supervisor which is Puan Norhayati introduce me to all the librarian and brief on the tasks that I have to do during my presence there.<br>After several days, I get my own task that I can do which is organizing Politeknik's activity throughout the year of 2021 as it was Movement Control Order phase.<br>Nevertheless, many activities are conducted online and I was assigned to choose the important activity to insert them in their annual Bulletin (magazine), Tinta Premier.<br>Other than that, I learn to do shelving as I have no idea how to read the call number of the books before. Thankfully, I have a good memory and competent enough once I have remember and do the work for several times.Besides, I learn the borrowing and returning book process, catalouging and process a new book and put them in library system. I experienced many things that I can apply for my study and future job. I am grateful that I get to know such a wonderful and kind people at the library as they are willing to help me if I face any problems with my tasks.</p></center>
